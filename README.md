Yeoman `deca-angular` generator
=======================

This is a Yeoman custom generator demo.

_package.json, _bower.json will be the files that will be copied to create the generator. 
package.json, bower.json are to be used for testing as they do not have dynamic components (such as name and author).

To try:

* Clone
* npm install
* npm link
* yo deca-angular

If using Yarn:

* Clone
* yarn
* yarn link
* yo deca-angular

After the scaffolding has finished:

If npm: `npm start`
If yarn: `yarn start`
